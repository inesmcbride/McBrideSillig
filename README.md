# McBrideSillig
A website for the McBride-Sillig wines to showcase their history, where they've come from and where the wines are today in a visual and informative manner. View the [full website here](www.mcbridesillig.co.nz).

# Background
The previous McBride-Sillig website was unresponsive and out-dated so the brief was to modernise and re-fresh the site ensuring it is fully responsive across all devices.

Using large baed image headers, and a single page layout I was able to create a simple, informative, modern site to be updated with.

Made using [Google Materialize](https://materializecss.com/about.html).
